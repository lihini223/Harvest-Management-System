# Harvest-Management-System
Ape aswenna is a web application to gather all the farmers, officers from department of agriculture (DOA) and Keels. This web application develops a market for the farmers to feed their harvest and facilitates keels staff to buy their goods. The DOA staff can check the quality reports through the web application and leave a feedback so that the keels staff can buy. And this application connects farmers with buyers(Keels staff) directly from all over the country. This will be an ideal platform for harvest management in Sri Lanka since this application generates reports and graphs on successful transactions, types of products, location summaries of farmers and wasted products. DOA staff can analyze reports and take necessary steps to resolve problems regarding to the harvest, farmers and buying operation easily.
